# How to Create a Blog Post

This page is your gateway to understanding the essential features that make your blog tick. Get ready to explore the key elements that make Docusaurus a powerful tool for bloggers.

### Framework

[Docusaurus blogging features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog) are powered by the [blog plugin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-blog). Simply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `blog` directory. The blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as:

- `2024-01-21.md`
- `2024-01-21-how-it-works/index.md`

### Page structure

Docusaurus relies on _frontmatter variables_ to generate the blog post page. Instead of using the Heading-1 level title from the content, it extracts information from these variables:

```
slug: page-url-slug
title: The title Docusaurus uses to show in a page
authors: [ceo, arijus]
tags: [any, words, here, become, tags]
```

Understanding this structure ensures a cohesive layout for your blog pages, allowing for a personalized and organized reader experience.

### Images

Explore two ways to add visuals to your blog:

1. **Centralized Folder**

   Keep your images in a centralized folder. Upload them to `/static/img/`:

2. **Next to the Post File**

   Place your images next to the post file. For example, `plants.png` can be stored next to the `index.md` file in the `2024-01-20-how-it-works` folder:[![A closeup shop of plants](./plants.jpg "A photo by Nahil Naseer")](https://unsplash.com/photos/green-leaf-plants-xljtGZ2-P3Y)

## Truncate

Limit the size of your blog posts in the list view using a `<!-- truncate -->` comment. In the Dhub editor, add it as an **embedded MDX** code block from "/" components menu:

<!--truncate-->

## React components

Docusaurus supports interactive components as part of the post's content. For example, if you insert this code block in Dhub's **embedded MDX** component:

```js
<button onClick={() => alert('button clicked!')}>Click me!</button>Tags
```

In the published site, it will show this element:

```mdx-code-block
<button onClick={() => alert('button clicked!')}>Click me!</button>
```

## Tags

Tagging system enhances the organization of your posts, making it easy for readers to explore content based on their interests.

Create new tags by adding them as _frontmatter variables_ at the start of the file:

```
tags: [tag 1, tag 2, tag 3]
```

## Authors

Understand how authors are managed through the `blog/authors.yml` file, ensuring proper attribution to content creators.

:::note

At the moment, Dhub editor doesn't support opening this file; it has to be configured outside the Dhub editor.
