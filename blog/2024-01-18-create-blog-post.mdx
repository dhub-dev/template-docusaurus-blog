# How to Create a Blog Post

[Docusaurus blogging features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog) are powered by the [blog plugin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-blog). Simply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `blog` directory. The blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as:

- `2024-01-21.md`
- `2024-01-21-how-it-works/index.md`

<!--truncate-->

## Truncate

Limit the size of your blog posts in the list view using a `<!-- truncate -->` comment. In the Dhub editor, add it as an **embedded MDX** code block from "/" components menu.

## Authors

Understand how authors are managed through the `blog/authors.yml` file, ensuring proper attribution to content creators.

:::note

At the moment, Dhub editor doesn't support opening this file; it has to be configured outside the Dhub editor.

Learn about the `authors.yml` file structure at Docusaurus documentation: [Docusaurus Blog Documentation - Global Authors.](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog#global-authors)
