# How to Create a Blog Post

[Docusaurus blogging features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog) are powered by the [blog plugin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-blog). Simply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `blog` directory. The blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as:

- `2024-01-21.md`
- `2024-01-21-how-it-works/index.md`

<!--truncate-->

## Truncate

To limit the length of the text from your blog post that appears in the list view, use the `<!-- truncate -->` MDX command. In Dhub's editor, you can insert it as an embedded MDX code. Simply access the command menu by typing `/`.
