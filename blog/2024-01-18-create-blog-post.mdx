# How to Create a Blog Post

[Docusaurus blogging features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog) are powered by the [blog plugin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-blog). Simply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `blog` directory. The blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as:

- `2024-01-21.md`
- `2024-01-21-how-it-works/index.md`

<!--truncate-->

## Truncate

Limit the lengh of the text in your blog post that appears in the list view using the `<!-- truncate -->` mdx command. In Dhub's editor, add it as an **embedded MDX** code using the command menu that opens when typing `/`.
